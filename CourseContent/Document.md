# Document Accessibility

<h2> Meaningful heading structure 	</h2>
<b> Bronze Level </b>

Heading structures with a distinct, visual style help individuals with visual impairments understand how a document is organized. Appropriate headings also act as secondary navigation tools that help readers skim and scan the document.

Headings should fit an outline. Making text larger or bolder does not make it a heading in Word.

<b> To Add headings to a document: </b>

Use the built-in heading styles to apply uniform heading structure to Word documents.

Word Styles contain preconfigured headings understood by assistive technology (e.g., Heading 1- Heading 6). These headings are available under the Styles section in the Home tab of the Ribbon.

Apply the ‚ÄúHeading 1‚Äù style for the main heading and ‚ÄúHeading 2‚Äù for sub-headings. Additional organization and division of topics should use the appropriate head style: ‚ÄúHeading 3,‚Äù ‚ÄúHeading 4,‚Äù etc. without going past "Heading 6."

Use the Home tab‚Äôs Styles menu to add heading styles.

<b> Verify headings </b>

Every heading in a document can be verified using the Navigation Pane, located in the Show group on the View tab of the Ribbon.

This pane also allows users to navigate to any section of the document by clicking on the corresponding heading.

Use the View tab to add navigation panes.


<h2> No use of color or shape to identify meaning </h2>
<b> Bronze Level </b>
<p> Do not use color or shapes to identify meaning as someone with color blindness, or someone with low vision might not be able to distinguish between the two options. For example, rather than using a green dot üü¢ to signify somehthing is Open, you can write <font color="green"> Open </font>  </p>

<h2> Meaningful/Descriptive Links </h2>
<b> Broze Level </b>
Hyperlink text must be clear and meaningful, with enough contextual information that a user would understand the link‚Äôs destination.  

You shouldn‚Äôt use ‚Äúclick here,‚Äù ‚Äúread more‚Äù and ‚Äúlearn more‚Äù as the only words linked.  
<ul> 
    <li> Do: ‚ÄúRead our strategic plan.‚Äù  </li>
    <li> Don't: ‚ÄúClick here for our strategic plan.‚Äù  </li>
</ul>

Similarly, don‚Äôt use the same link language for two different destinations. For example, if ‚ÄúContact Us‚Äù is listed as a link twice on the same page, it should take users to the same place.   

<h2> Accessible Tables 	 </h2>
<b> Bronze Level </b>

Microsoft products can only produce simple tables, meaning tables with 1 heading row and 1 heading column at max. There are several steps to creating an accessible table:
<ol>
  <li> Should this be a table? <br> If your table should actually be a list, it is better to make that a bulleted list, rather using a table format. Additionally, if you are using a table for stlying purposes, like creating 2 columns of text, its better to use Microsofts 'Column' option to create those columsn.
 </li>
  <li> Do I need to simplify the table? <br> If you have a complex table, with nested cotent, and multiple heading rows or columns you will need to break those tables into smaller ones to allow the screen reader to read it correctly.</li>
  <li> Designate a heading row <br>
  The "Table Style Options" section of the ribbon on the Table Tools contextual tab lets you indicate that your data has a header row.

  </li>
  <li> Repeat Column headings  <br>
  Column headings should be repeated at the top of a table if the table spans multiple pages.
<br>
To repeat the column headings:
<ul>
  <li>   Right-click the table, and then select Table Properties. </li>
  <li>   In the "Table Properties" dialog box, select the Row tab. </li>
  <li>   In the "Options" group, make sure Repeat as header row at the top of each page is checked. </li>
  <li>   Uncheck the box next to Allow row to break across pages. </li>
  <li>   Select OK to accept the changes. </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Add alternative text to the table <br>
    To add alternative text for tables, use the Alt Text tab of the "Table Properties" dialog box. You can do this by right clicking on the table, and selecting Table properties, then select the Alt-Text tab.

  </li>
</ol>

<h2> Use of PPT templates layouts only (PPT) </h2>
<b> Bronze Level </b>
Powerpoint comes with several built in layouts: A title slide, Title with one content section, title with two content areas, etc. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7b3ac89-b656-49e8-8d3a-5a5deadaf585)

Using these layouts only, will ensure that  your powerpoints have the correct reading order, titles for every slide, and there are no floating objects that might be difficult for a screen reader to access.  

If you are unsure of how to make accessible powerpoints, avoid adding floating textboxes, or floating images (items not part of the standard layout). Additionally, avoide using the blank slide unless it is truly as a blank slide.

<h2> Provide clean copies of printed/scanned materials. This includes handouts, course reserves, course packs, etc.  </h2>
<b> Bronze Level </b>
<p> Avoid using content that is smugged,has words cut  off, or is difficult for you to read. If you have a hard time reading it, someone with Low Vision, or who is blind will not be able to read this at all. </p>
	
<h2> Searchable PDFs only </h2>
<b> Bronze Level </b>
<p> Searchable PDFs are those that the text is rendered as acutal text and not images. A simple way of knowing if this is case, is by seeing if you can highlight  the text. If you are unable to, Adobe Acrobat has an <a href="https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/hub/use-ocr-to-read-text-from-image.html"> OCR function </a>, that allows you to digitize that PDF into a searcable PDF. Additionally you can use tools like <a href="https://it.rutgers.edu/digital-accessibility/knowledgebase/sensusaccess/"> Sensus Access </a> to convert your docuemnt. </p>
