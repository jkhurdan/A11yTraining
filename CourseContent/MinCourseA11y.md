# Minimum Course Accessibility Guidelines

## Preface
We've developed a list of items to help you create more accessible courses. It's important to note that document and digital accessibility is only a small piece to making your course accessible. We recommend you read the following pages to help walk yoou through other important informatino you should know:
* [Accessible Design Guide](https://github.com/jkhurdan/A11yTraining/wiki/Accessible-Content-Guide) - This guide will give you information about important design choices when making content that will greatly benefit your students. It will also give you important information about to structure/conduct your lectures.
* [Hosting Accessible Trainings](https://github.com/jkhurdan/A11yTraining/wiki/Hosting-Accessible-Trainings) - While this was written with workshops in mind, this will give you great insight into best teaching practices

## Overview of the standards
In order to make accessibility more achievable, and reflect the students who are actually in your class being able to benefit the most, we've developed a good, better, best model. 

**Bronze level**
In this model, the Bronze level is our minimum level of accessibility that we would like all courses to reach. It is based on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines  (WCAG) version 2.1 Level A. This is the minimum level countries/organizations could choose to adopt. Here in the U.S the DOJ has adopted Level AA, and thus courses in this category do not meet the full letter of the law for course accessibility. 

This level is meant to provide you an achievable first step, and allow an easy pathway to Silver (which is based mostly on WCAG 2.1 AA). Bronze is a baseline for courses, and is not intended to be your final outcome.

**Silver Level**
For courses above a certain enrollment, we are asking all of those courses to achieve a Silver level. This was based on WCAG 2.1 AA, but also takes into account that there are certain aspects of WCAG that may be more difficult for faculty to achieve with out help/intervention from others on campus, i.e the Office of Disability Services (ODS).

The items in this category are meant to be easy achievable given the foundation you have laid from the bronze level, and it also sets up departments like ODS and Rutgers Access and Disability Services to easily provide accommodations/support for students needing accommodations. 

**Gold Level**
Any course with a student with a disability, that is approved for accommoodations falls into this level. This level fully conforms to WCAG 2.1 AA and details offices you should be working with to acheive certain accommodations (like ASL Interpreters).

## Consdieratiosn on how to use these levels
Ideally this should be a gradient of colors opposed to three distinct colors side by side. We've created a form that allows you to determine your minimual base level and then adds only those specific guidelines that apply to your course. For example, if you have a student with a disability, and that students is approved for an ASL interpreter, we can make general assumptions about the nature of their disability. Knowing this we will provide you with Silver level as your base level, and all those that apply to this student we'll provide you with gold level items. To put into practice you'll see items about professional video captioning (which is likely another accommodation they have) but not Audio descriptions as this student is likely a sighted student and doesn't require audio descriptions.

The goal is to provide you a road map of the items that are going to make the most impact in your course, as you work overtime to improve the accessibility of your course.
