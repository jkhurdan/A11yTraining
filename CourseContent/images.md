# Images

## 1.1 All instructor created content must have a useful alt-text for all images.
**Bronze Level**

Alternative text for images, also known as alt text, is a description of an image read by assistive technology. It also helps search engines understand the content of an image, which can improve SEO.

The alt text should convey the purpose and function of the non-text content. This means that the same image may have different alt text depending on its context and purpose. For example, an image used for marketing will have different alt text than the same image used for training purposes.

Alt text is more art than science. The only "wrong" is not including alt text where it is needed. Considering alt text on a scale of "good" versus "better" will you help craft more useful alt text.

<li> <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/6199477?hl=en"> A google Document or Presentation </a></li>
</ul>

### General Guidelines
<ul>
  <li> Keep the alt text concise (no more than 10-15 words). </li>
  <li> If the image contains words, include the words in the alt text. </li>
  <li> If the image is used as a link or control, the alt text should help form the link text or control label. </li>
  <li> If the alt text would be redundant to neighboring text, treat the image as if it is decorative. </li>
</ul>

## 1.2 Student provided with instrcutions/expectations on how to add alt-text to content they create.
**Silver level**

In many cases faculty may be using third-party software that allows students to create content in discussion forums, messages, etc. It's important that you are providing students with directions on how to make their content accessible. 

Below is an example for the Canvas discussions thread

**Example 1. Canvas Discussions** 

1. Click on image dropdown, and then upload image
<img width="885" alt="Screenshot of the Upload Image icon" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c61c5aa5-8aad-4d3b-8c17-f33913f76b0f">

2. After uploading your image, scroll down and fill in the Alt Text box under Attributes
<img width="926" alt="screen shot showing the Alt Text comment box, located under Attributes" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5454a819-8d3f-412c-966e-30f855aa608d">

**Example 2. No Alt-text option available**

In some applications, there may not be a way to add an alt-text to an image. In these cases, it is best practices to put an image description below the image.

<img width="446" alt="Hierarchy map that shows the Office of IT, with three departments under it: Enterprise Application services, Enterprise Delivery Services, Infrustructure and Security" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d168da2-3cbb-4087-bb4b-48504d548b8e">

**Image Caption:** An Organization heiracty chart showing the Office of IT on top, with 3 departments reporting to it: Enterprise Application Services, Enterprise Delivery Services, Infustructure and Security. 

## 1.3 Long descriptions provided for items where alt-text is not use-able.	
**Gold Level**

In some cases, a short alt-text is not enough information to convey the meaning of the image.

**Example**

<img width="598" alt="Meidan Income by Race, 2001. See chart below for data." src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ace98a9-6f69-4a14-984d-2527dbb30448">

Figure 1-1  Median net worth by race, 2001 (assets minus debts)

**Image Description:** The bar chart above is represented by the data below, with Years along the y axis, and Dollars long the x axis. 
<table>
  <tr>
    <th> Race </th>
    <th> 1998 </th>
    <th> 2001</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> White People </td>
    <td> $103,400 </td>
    <td> $120,900</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> People of Color </td>
    <td> $17,900 </td>
    <td> $17,100</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## 1.4 Alternative provided where long description is not use-able.
**Gold Level**

In some cases, you may need to work with your office of disability services to provide items in alternate ways, such as embossed images, as seen in the example below.
