# Images

## 1.1 All instructor created content must have a useful alt-text for all images.
**Bronze Level**

Alternative text for images, also known as alt text, is a description of an image read by assistive technology. It also helps search engines understand the content of an image, which can improve SEO.

The alt text should convey the purpose and function of the non-text content. This means that the same image may have different alt text depending on its context and purpose. For example, an image used for marketing will have different alt text than the same image used for training purposes.

Alt text is more art than science. The only "wrong" is not including alt text where it is needed. Considering alt text on a scale of "good" versus "better" will you help craft more useful alt text.

</ul>

### General Guidelines
<ul>
  <li> Keep the alt text concise (no more than 10-15 words). </li>
  <li> If the image contains words, include the words in the alt text. </li>
  <li> If the image is used as a link or control, the alt text should help form the link text or control label. </li>
  <li> If the alt text would be redundant to neighboring text, treat the image as if it is decorative. </li>
</ul>
