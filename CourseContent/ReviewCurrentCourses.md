# Review Existing Courses

We recommend following the steps outlined below to help you improve the accessibility of your courses:

1. Run [CidiLabs Tidy Up](https://canvas.rutgers.edu/external-apps/cidilabs-tidyup/).
 <br> TidyUp scans the Canvas course for unused pages and unlinked files and remove them from the course. Access TidyUp through Rutgers Canvas by [enabling it in the course navigation](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-manage-Course-Navigation-links/ta-p/1020).
2. Run [Canvas Ally](https://canvas.rutgers.edu/external-apps/ally/)
 <br> Ally is a software tool that focuses on making digital course content more accessible. It helps instructors gain detailed insight into the accessibility of their course content, provides guidance to faculty and instructors on how to improve the accessibility of their content, and automatically provides students with a range of more accessible alternative formats.
3. [Determine your priorities](https://jkhurdan.github.io/A11yTraining/CourseContent/CourseContentHelperV2.html)
   <br> We've developed a tool to help you determine what parts of your course you should focus on. If you have already started the semester we recommend you:
   * Start with your syllabuus and any documents a student will refer to over the course of the semester
   * Review the items in provided in the priorities guide
   * Review course content for this week moving forward

## Other considerations:
As you remediate your course files here are some other things you should consider

### PDFs
With all of your PDFs you should follow our PDF workflow:
1. Remove any unused PDFS from your course. Tid yUp is a great tool for doing this.
2. Reorganize your site. For those documents that you'd like to keep but are for archival purposes only, you should move them to a folder clearly marked Archived.
3. Reformat your PDF. If your document was originally a word or PPT file, we recommend uploading that version opposed to the PDF. You can upload read only files to ensure the content remains the same. PDFs that could be webforms or module pages, we recommend converting to webforms/html pages.
4. Remediate the remainder. For those PDFs that truely need to be PDFS, we reccomend you utilize tools like SensusAccess to provide text-based documents to your students.

### Resource Selection
With some documents, you may find that the original is too difficult for even a sighted person to read. Scans with text cut off, smudges, faded writing, etc may not be feasible to make into an accessible document. You should review your course resources to make sure that the resources provided are legible. 

### Utilize native Canvas tools over Third-Party Apps
When possible, you should utilize native Canvas tools like Canvas Discussions, Quizzes, and Modules. We have tested these items and have found to be accessible. Using external tools may provide inaccessible experiences to some students.
