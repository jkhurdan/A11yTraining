# Review Existing Courses

We recommend following the steps outlined below to help you improve the accessibility of your courses:

1. Run TidyUp.
  This tool helps you remove duplicate documents and pages on your site to ensure you only have the most current versions in your Canvas Shell.
2. Run Canvas Ally
   This tool will help you identify the acccessibility issues in your course.
3. Determine your priorities
   We've developed a tool to help you determine what parts of your course who should focus on. If you have already started the semester we recommend you:
   * Start with your syllabuus and any documents a student will refer to over the course of the semester
   * Review the items in provided in the priorities guide
   * Review course content for this week moving forward

## Other considerations:
As you remediate your course files here are some other things you should consider

### PDFs
With all of your PDFs you should follow our PDF model:
1. Remove any unused PDFS from your course. TidyUp is a great tool for doing this.
2. Reorganize your site. For those documents that you'd like to keep but are for archival purposes only, you should move them to a folder clearly marked Archived.
3. Reformat your PDF. If your document was originally a word or PPT file, we recommend uploading that version opposed to the PDF. You can upload read only files to ensure the content remains the same. PDFs that could be webforms or module pages, we recommend converting to webforms/html pages.
4. Remediate the remainder. For those PDFs that truely need to be PDFS, we reccomend you utilize tools like SensusAccess to provide text-based documents to your students.
