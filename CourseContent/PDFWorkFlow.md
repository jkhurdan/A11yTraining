# Managing PDFs

With all of your PDFs you should follow our PDF workflow:
1. Remove any unused PDFS from your course. Tid yUp is a great tool for doing this.
2. Reorganize your site. For those documents that you'd like to keep but are for archival purposes only, you should move them to a folder clearly marked Archived.
3. Reformat your PDF. If your document was originally a word or PPT file, we recommend uploading that version opposed to the PDF. You can upload read only files to ensure the content remains the same. PDFs that could be webforms or module pages, we recommend converting to webforms/html pages.
4. Remediate the remainder. For those PDFs that truely need to be PDFS, we reccomend you utilize tools like SensusAccess to provide text-based documents to your students.
