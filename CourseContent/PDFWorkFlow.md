# Managing PDFs

With all of your PDFs, you should follow our PDF workflow:
1. Remove any unused PDFs from your course. Tid yUp is a great tool for doing this.
2. Reorganize your site. For those documents that you'd like to keep but are for archival purposes only, you should move them to a folder clearly marked Archived.
3. Reformat your PDF. If your document was originally a Word or PPT file, we recommend uploading that version instead of the PDF. You can upload read-only files to ensure the content remains the same. We recommend converting PDFs that could be webforms or module pages to webforms/html pages.
4. Remediate the remainder. For those PDFs that truly need to be PDFS, we recommend you utilize tools like SensusAccess to provide text-based documents to your students.
