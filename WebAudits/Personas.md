# Disability Personas 
Our office will test for 5 types of disabilities, below are the categories and the different persona types

## Blindness
Blindess is defined legally in the US as having central acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye, evenwith corrective lenses, or a visual field of 20 degrees or less. It's important to note, that many people who are blind, still have some vision. People who are blind, will typically use a screen reader.  A screen reader converts text, buttons, images and other screen elements into speech or braille. It also allows users to interact with the content on their screen using their keyboard only. There are many reason why and individual might choose not to use a screen reader. Many individuals with low-vision will continue to use what vision they have, which can cause further eye strain. Using a screen reader, can often times be a difficult decision as it comes with the acceptance that you are blind.

There are 3 main levels of screen reader users: 
<table>
    <tbody><tr>
        <th width="150px"> Level </th>
        <th> Description </th>
        <th> Common Commands </th>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
        <td> Level 1: Basic access user (beginner) </td>
        <td> Basic understanding of how to use the screen reader. May use it only when 'needed'. These individuals may be:
            <ul>
                <li> Newly diagnosed </li>
                <li> Non-Tech Savvy individuals </li>
                <li> Individuals with Low-Vision who avoids using this software </li>
            </ul>
        </td>
        <td> Tab, Arrow Keys, Space, Enter </td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
        <td> Level 2: Every-day users (intemediate) </td>
        <td> Every-day User, who knows the most commonly used features. They are likely connected with the commission, and has received basic training. These individuals may have/be:
            <ul>
                <li> Connected with a state agency like the Commission for the Blind </li>
                <li> Have gone to a school for the blind </li>
                <li> Utilizes other tools as part of an ecosystem to navigate the world </li>
            </ul>  
        </td>
        <td> Use of a rotator, able to navigate via list of links, headings, landmarks, etc. Often times this persons device is set up for optimal use by a screen reader. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> Level 3: Advanced Users </td>
        <td> Often times this is a highly technical person, who utilizes advanced or developing features of a tool. They are more likely to switch between multiple devices, and types of screen readers. </td>
        <td> May use speech command function, OCR page functions, etc. </td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>

###  Screen Reader Usage 
Most users on a Windows device, will use both NVDA and JAWS. Those on an iOS or MacOS device will likely be using VoiceOver. Here are few facts to keep in mind:

* According to a 2024 survey by WebAim, "63% of those with disabilities considered their proficiency to be 'Advanced'" [^1]. In order to ensure that every person is able to use an item, we test it based on the least proficent user. When we do usability testing, we will denote however areas that an intermediate or advanced person could utilize, and provide those keyboard commands for reference for a beginner. 
* "71.6% of respondents use more than one desktop/laptop screen reader. 43% use three or more, and 17.4% use four or more different screen readers. VoiceOver users most commonly use additional screen readers[^2]." According to the survey most individusal with disabilities reported JAWS as their primary screen reader, while also reporting they used NVDA most commonly [^2].
* The majority of users will use Chrome with JAWS (24.7%) or NVDA (21.3%) [^3]. As such when we test we use a chrome browser.
* 86.1% reported having a Windows device, with only 9.6% reported having a Mac [^4].

#### Installing your Screen Reader

* [ NVDA ](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/)can be installed on any windows device.
* [ JAWS ](https://portal.freedomscientific.com/SponsoredSoftware)can be installed from the freedom scientific website using your [at]rutgers.edu email address.
* [VoiceOver](https://support.apple.com/guide/voiceover/welcome/mac) comes preinstalled on all iOS and MacOS devices

Note: Be sure to adjust your settings after installation to prevent it from launching at startup, unless you would prefer these settings.


## Low Vision
Low vision is often times groups with Blindness, however there is braod spectrum of disabilities that can cause low vision, including bluriness, floating spots that might casuse parital vision-loss. While it is often times seens as the precursor to blindness, and sometimes is, there are many people who fall into this category that will never loss their sight to the level that is considered blindness. In fact, "90% of individuals with vision impairments have some amount of usable, functional vision" [^5].

It's important to note, low-vision is also something that might impact someone differently, under different conditions. For example, some people may have diffiult seeing due to low light.

Below is the types of personas that we test for:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th> Type </th>
        <th> Description </th>
        <th> Tools used </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> Vision Loss/vision impairment </td>
        <td> This is your traditional group, that might have: <br>
        <ul>
            <li> Central vision loss (not being able to see things in the center of your vision) </li>
            <li> Peripheral vision loss (not being able to see things out of the corners of your eyes) </li>
            <li> Blurry or hazy vision </li>
        </ul>
        </td>
        <td> Traditionally they are using some sort of screen magnifier.  </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> Color vision </td>
        <td> There are several types of color impairment categories): <br>
        <ul>
            <li> Red-Green (including Deuteranomaly, Protanomaly, Protanopia and deuteranopia) </li>
            <li> Blue-yell (including Tritanomaly and Tritanopia) </li>
            <li> Complete color vision loss (aka monochromaacy) </li>
        </ul>  </td>
        <td> These user may use color filters, however we want to design to ensure the can access items with out the use of assistive technologies. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> Contrast Sensitivity </td>
        <td> Contrast sensitivity is the ability to tell the difference between two similar colors or shades of gray. It helps you recognize an object as being separate from the background behind it. Contrast sensitivity is now considered as important as visual acuity, as it affects the quality of vision.  </td>
        <td> These users may use color filters, however poor design and prevent any access despite use of tools. </td>
    </tr>
</table>

## d/Deaf and Hard of Hearing
Deaf (with a capital D) refers to someone who identifies as being part of the Deaf community and shares a cultural identity. These users will typically use sign language, captioning and other tools. Important to note, Deaf individuals may have different skill levels and preferences with regards to ASL, in addition they may prefer a combination of tools (like Captioning for listen, and ASL for interacting). deaf (with a lowercase d) refers to someone who has significant hearing loss, but does not identify with this the Deaf community. They often times have assistive devices to improve or aid their hearing, like cochlear implants.

This category has a few persona types:
<table>
    <tr>
        <th> Type </th>
        <th> Description </th>
        <th> Tools used </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> Deaf and severe hearing loss </td>
        <td> These individuals are typically part of the Deaf Community, which holds certain beliefs and cultural norms around Deafness and how they interact with the world. </td>
        <td> They rely on captioning, however may also prefer ASL. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> Hard of Hearing/ Audio Processing Disorders </td>
        <td> These individuals may have a range of hearing loss, or hearing related disabilties. They often use some sort of assistive device like a hearing aid, cochlear implant, or FM system in their day to day lives. </td>
        <td> They will use captioning, and sometimes they will prefer auto-captioning when profesionally captioning is not available.</td>
    </tr>
</table>


## Physical/Motor
Physical and motor disabilities involve weakness, limitations, and impaired control of muscles and movement, and can stem from congenital conditions, diseases, and injuries. Common examples include cerebral palsy, which affects muscle control; muscular dystrophy, a muscle-wasting condition; spina bifida, a congenital condition impacting the spinal cord; and spinal cord injury leading to paralysis. Other examples are multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease, both affecting muscle control and movement, along with conditions like arthritis and amputation. 

This group is divided in our testing between severe impairments, where they user may rely on only the movements of a individual part of their body, or low to moderate where the user may be using some sort of adaptive device.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th> Type </th>
        <th> Description </th>
        <th> Tools used </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> Severe  </td>
        <td> These users have very limited mobility use, may be include users with Cerebral Palsey, Musclar Dystrophy, etc. They require the use of very specialized software to interact with a computer.  </td>
        <td> Some examples include Head tracking, eye tracking, or Speech command tools like Dragon Naturally Speaking. These tools use the metadata (like labeling of links and buttons) to allow the user to dictate how to interact with that element, or use their tracking tools to 'click' on an item. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> Low to Moderate </td>
        <td> These individuals have some mobility, and will often rely on that limited mobility to opperate a computer/device. This is often through the use of adaptive keyboards, mouses, stylist, etc. </td>
        <td>  These users may use an Adaptive mouse, sip and puff or other tool which often times mimics a simple on/off command, or tab keyboard command. It is often time less robust in its functionality and ability then those tools used by more severe disabilties (like speech commmand).  </td>
    </tr>
</table>


## Cognitive, Learning and Nuerological 
This category probably makes up the majority of disability types/users. It includes a range of executive functioning, mental illness, brain injurites, learning disabilities like dyslexia or dyscalculia, or specific disabilties in reading, writing, math, etc. Many of the people who fall into this category will not see themselves as 'disabled enough' to request accommodations, or identify as someone with a disability. As such the number of people who fall into this category is probably even higher then what is reported. 

<table>
    <tr>
        <th> Type </th>
        <th> Description </th>
        <th> Tools used </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> Seizuer Disorders </td>
        <td> These users may suffer from conditions like epilespy. Seizures may be caused by repeated flashing of lights, which may be present in images, videos, or other graphics  </td>
        <td> n/a </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> Text to Speeh users </td>
        <td> Many users with learngin disabilities, or some sort to print disability will use a tool to have the page read out loud to them.  </td>
        <td>  Text to Speech tools  </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
           <td> Text and Page modifiers </td>
        <td> There are a wide range of disabilty tyeps, including those with concussions, visual processing disorders, Specific learning disabilities, etc that may use tools to adjust how the text and page appears on the screen.  </td>
        <td>  This might include the following tools:
            <ul>
                <li> Text modifiers like BeeLine reader which changes the weight of the font as you read the line.  </li>
                <li> Text modifiers that change the font to a dyslic friendly font </li>
                <li> Page modifiers that change the line spacing, background color/font color, etc </li>
                <li> Dark Mode users </li>
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

## Speech
While this is not typically on the list of disability user profiles seen in website testing, we have added this category AI Chat Bots have become very prevalent. As many are offing speech input options, its important that we are identifying these items. There are many types of speech impairments, with a range in speech clearness. 

For this item, we are simply identifying anytime a speech input is available, and noting that someone with a speech impairment may have difficulty using this feature. We are also checking to ensure an alternate means of accessing that tool is available.
