# Captions and Transcripts
According to US government figures, one person in eight has some functional hearing limitation, and this number will increase as the average age of the population increases. Beyond people with disabilities, captioning helps people who only partially understand the language presented. Captions are also useful in noisy environments like airports, in quiet environments like libraries, and for multimodal learning.

## Appropriate Use
### Captions on Audio/Video content
You can use tools like Kaltura Media Space as a starting point for creating automated captions. For people with disabilities, automated tools may not be enough to provide appropriate accessible versions. For captions you will want to review the captions to ensure that the captions are accurate.

### Transcripts as alternative media
Transcripts, unlike captions, are not always scryronized with the audio content. For items like podcasts, TedTalks, interviews, or other mediums where there isn't alot of additional movement and sounds that need to be referenced a transcript could be an acceptable media alternative. 

### Captions in third party sites
If you are using a third-party tool like Youtube, often times you can click a filter button after searching, to filter for those videa with captions. 

On youtube, after searching, click the filter button to the far right, followed by 'Subtitltes/CC' to only show vides with captions. Please note, you will still verify the accuracy of these captions. These can then be imported into Kaltura to further edit captions as needed.

### Captioning Guidelines
The Described and Captioned Media Program (DCMP) has created standards for formatting and dispalying captions. In addition the W3C Web accessibility Intatitive (WAI) has technical standards for WebVTT (closed captions fomartted files). Below are some of the highlights for you to review:
* Limit lines to 32 characters or less, including spaces
* It is prefered that there is no more than 1-2 lines of text per screen.
* Use sentence case rather than all CAPS
* Use a readable font of average thickness. Use of white characters is prefered, with medium weighted sans serif font. 
* Text should be centered on the screen and left-aligned
* Color contrast should be sufficent to stand out against the background (but not visually distruptive)
* Captions should a have a mimumun duration of 40 frames (~1.5 seconds) and a maximum duration of 6 seconds. (Background music notation is an exception to this guideline).

## How to test for compliance
### Are the captions accurate
You should always review the captions to ensure that they are accurate, which includes:
* Accuracy – Errorless captions are the goal. Correct grammar and punctuation are important to convey intended meaning (e.g., “Let’s eat, Grandma” vs. “Let’s eat Grandma”).
* Consistency – Uniformity in style and presentation of all captioning features is crucial for viewer understanding.
* Clarity – A complete textual representation of the audio, including speaker identification and non-speech information, provides clarity.
* Readability – Captions need to be displayed for long enough to be read completely. They need to be synchronized with the audio, and they must neither obscure nor be obscured by the visual content.
* Equality – Equal access requires that the meaning and the intention of the material are preserved as much as possible.


## Common Mistakes
### Not checking for accuracy
In many cases unusual words like Rutgers, may appear as Rukers. Be sure you are reviewing the captions prior to publishing your video.
