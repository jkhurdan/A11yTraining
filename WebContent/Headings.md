# Headings
Headingsare imporant, as it creates a structure that allows screen readers to navigate your site. It also improves the usability of your site, making it easy for viewers to find the information they need.

## Appropriate Use
### Code Example
You should use the appropriate heading tag, as outlined below. You can style these in your .CSS file to adjust the look and feel of each heading level
```html
  <h1> Main Topic </h1>
```

### Appropriately nest headings
Each heading should be appropriately nested as in the eample below, following a logical order.
```html
<h1> Main Topic </h1>
  <h2> Comparison </h2>
      <h3> Reason 1 </h3>
      <h3> Reason 2 </h3>
  <h2> Contrast </h2>

```

## How to test for compliance
We recommend using the [Skip to Headings browser extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/skipto-landmarks-headings/fjkpbfcodhflpdildjbmdhhmcoplghgf?pli=1) on Google Chrome. This will allow you to visually see the heading structure on your page

## Common Mistakes
### Empty Headers
A common mistake we see is when using a content management system, sometimes you may remove a header but the design tool as left a space where it was. This results in an empty heading.
```html
<h2>  <h2>
<p> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor
incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud
exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. </p>
```
