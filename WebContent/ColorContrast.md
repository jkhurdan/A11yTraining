# Color Contrast
Color is a powerful design tool, helps convey meaning, and draws attention to content. It must be used thoughtfully so it does not present a barrier to people with disabilities, such as those who are colorblind, have low vision, or use grayscale monitors.

## Appropriate Use
### Text on a sold background
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines require that text - and images of text - provide a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1. This is ratio between the foreground and background colors.
